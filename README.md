# FYS-STK4155

Our group consists of Simon Hille, Semya Tønnessen and Oskar Hafstad.

We have an extended deadline until monday 17/10/2022 and will continue to update this repo until midnight on the 17th of October.

The changes after midnight was mainly clean up removing files that should not be in repo and make it so that code ran on Simons computer also which it did not untill we uncommented a single line. We were also unaware that we could include figures in the repo ref: 
"• In your GitHub/GitLab or similar repository, please include a folder which contains selected results. These can be in the form of output from your code for a selected set of runs and input parameters" therefore we added back in figures folder with figures in it. Figures folder is also needed for paths in plt.save(). To produce plots run LinearRegression.py for Franke function analysis and real_data.py for Terrain data analysis.
