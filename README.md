# FYS-STK4155

Our group consists of Simon Hille, Semya TÃ¸nnessen and Oskar Hafstad.

We have an extended deadline until monday 17/10/2022 and will continue to update this repo until midnight on the 17th of October.

The changes after midnight was mainly clean up removing files that should not be in repo. We found a last minute bug so the code did not run, which we fixed with some uncommenting. We were also unaware that we could include figures in the repo therefore we added back in figures folder with figures in it. Figures folder is also needed for paths in plt.save(). To produce plots run LinearRegression.py for Franke function analysis and real_data.py for Terrain data analysis.
