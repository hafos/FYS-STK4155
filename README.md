# FYS-STK4155
Our group consists of Simon Hille, Semya TÃ¸nnessen and Oskar Hafstad.

------------------------
PROJECT 1:
We have an extended deadline until monday 17/10/2022 and will continue to update this repo until midnight on the 17th of October.

The changes after midnight was mainly clean up removing files that should not be in repo. We also sadly found a last minute bug that prevent the code from running, which we had to fix after midnight. In addition to that we added back the figures folder with figures in it. We were unaware that we could include figures in the repo thats why we removed it in the first place. To produce plots run LinearRegression.py for Franke function analysis and real_data.py for Terrain data analysis.
