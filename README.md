# FYS-STK4155

Our group consists of Simon Hille, Semya TÃ¸nnessen and Oskar Hafstad.

We have an extended deadline until monday 17/10/2022 and will continue to update this repo until midnight on the 17th of October.

The changes after midnight was simply clean up removing files that should not be in repo. To produce plots run LinearRegression.py for Franke function analysis and real_data.py for Terrain data analysis. In LinearRegression to run different parts comment/uncomment correct parts in if __name__ == '__main__':.
