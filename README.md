# FYS-STK4155

Our group consists of Simon Hille, Semya TÃ¸nnessen and Oskar Hafstad.

We have an extended deadline until monday 17/10/2022 and will continue to update this repo until midnight on the 17th of October.

The changes after midnight was mainly clean up removing files that should not be in repo and make it so that code ran on Simons computer also which it did not untill we uncommented a single line. To produce plots run LinearRegression.py for Franke function analysis and real_data.py for Terrain data analysis.
