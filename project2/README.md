The second project in Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learing of Oskar Hafstad, Simon H. Hille & Semya A. TÃ¸nnessen. 

## Abstract 
XXX: Insert abstract from pdf here 

## Dependencies 
Requires python3 
Check your version by running 
``` python3 --version ``` 

The project makes use of the following libraries: 
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `time`
- `XXX: Insert all libraries used when project is complete.`

## Running the code 
XXX Remember to move all code so this works 
Run all code from the folder `code`. 

The plots are generated by running the following: 
- Part a) Run `python3 gen_plots_a.py`
- Part b) Run `python3 gen_plots_b.py`

## Contents 
The folder `code` contains the functions for generating the plots, `gen_plots_*.py`, as well as a subfolder `src` which contains the source code: 
- `cost_act_func.py`: Contains cost functions and activation functions. 
- `FFNN.py`: Class for our own Feed-Forward-Neural-Net code. 
- `gen_data`: Generates datasets. Can generate either a polynomial or the Franke Function. 
- `Grad_Decent.py`: Class for performing Gradient Decent methods on a given dataset. 
- `Linear_Regression.py`: Class for performing linear regression methods on a given dataset. 
- `S_Grad_Decent.py`: Class for performing Stochastic Gradient Decent methods on a given dataset. 

## Tests 
The code was last tested with the operating system `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`.
