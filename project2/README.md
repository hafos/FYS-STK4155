Classes for studying classification problems using logistic regression and a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), 
in addition to classification problems using FFNN. 

## Dependencies 
Requires python3 
Check your version by running 
``` python3 --version ``` 

## Contents 
- `cost_act_func.py`: Contains cost functions and activation functions. 
- `FFNN.py`: Class for our own Feed-Forward-Neural-Net code. 
- `gen_data`: Generates datasets. Can generate either a polynomial or the Franke Function. 
- `Grad_Decent.py`: Class for performing Gradient Decent methods on a given dataset. 
- `Linear_Regression.py`: Class for performing linear regression methods on a given dataset. 
- `S_Grad_Decent.py`: Class for performing Stochastic Gradient Decent methods on a given dataset. 

## Running the code 
Run all code from the folder `project2`. 
- Part a) Run `python3 exercises/gen_plots_a.py`
- Part b) Run `python3 exercises/gen_plots_b.py`

## Tests 
The code was last tested with the operating system `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`.
